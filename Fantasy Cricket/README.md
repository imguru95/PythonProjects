This is a modified and improved version of my training project done as part of the course - "Programming with Python" on Internshala.

Fantasy cricket is an online game where you can create a virtual team of real cricketers and score points depending on how your chosen players perform in actual matches. Fantasy cricket apps are used by many people around the world. This is a desktop application unlike the actual fantasy cricket apps which are web applications. Moreover, the matches I have used in my project have already happened in the past and the users can create virtual teams and compare their standings for a particular match.

Tools and libraries used in this project - Python 3.9.0, PyQt5, sqlite3, num2words
