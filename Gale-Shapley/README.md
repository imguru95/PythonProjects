# Gale-Shapley
Implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm - The Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to solve the stable marriage problem and the code here implements it using four males and four females as the two sets that need to be matched. Every male and female has two sets of personality traits - his/her own set and a desired set of personality traits. The preference orders for males and females are generated using the male to female and female to male match differences(compatibility scores). Male to female match differences are generated using the desired personality sets of the females and the original personality sets of the males. Female to male match differences are generated using the desired personality sets of the males and the original personality sets of the females.
